HTTP Recommendations
Regardless of what modules are compiled and used, Apache as a basic web server complies with the following IETF recommendations:

Language/Country Codes
The following links document ISO and other language and country code information:
ISO 639-2 
ISO 639 provides two sets of language codes, one as a two-letter code set (639-1) and another as a three-letter code set (this part of ISO 639) for the representation of names of languages. 
ISO 3166-1 
These pages document the country names (official short names in English) in alphabetical order as given in ISO 3166-1 and the corresponding ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 code elements. 
BCP 47 (Best Current Practice), RFC 3066 
This document describes a language tag for use in cases where it is desired to indicate the language used in an information object, how to register values for use in this language tag, and a construct for matching such language tags. 
RFC 3282 (Standards Track) 
This document defines a "Content-language:" header, for use in cases where one desires to indicate the language of something that has RFC 822-like headers, like MIME body parts or Web documents, and an "Accept-Language:" header for use in cases where one wishes to indicate one's preferences with regard to language.
