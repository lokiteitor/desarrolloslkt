Apache Module mod_proxy_express
Description:
Dynamic mass reverse proxy extension for mod_proxy
Status:
Extension
Module Identifier:
proxy_express_module
Source File:
mod_proxy_express.c
Summary
This module creates dynamically configured mass reverse proxies, by mapping the Host: header of the HTTP request to a server name and backend URL stored in a DBM file. This allows for easy use of a huge number of reverse proxies with no configuration changes. It is much less feature-full than mod_proxy_balancer, which also provides dynamic growth, but is intended to handle much, much larger numbers of backends. It is ideally suited as a front-end HTTP switch.
This module requires the service of mod_proxy.
Warning
Do not enable proxying until you have secured your server. Open proxy servers are dangerous both to your network and to the Internet at large.
Limitations
This module is not intended to replace the dynamic capability of mod_proxy_balancer. Instead, it is intended to be mostly a lightweight and fast alternative to using mod_rewrite with RewriteMap and the [P] flag for mapped reverse proxying. 
It does not support regex or pattern matching at all. 
It emulates: 
ProxyPass / backend.server:port
ProxyPassReverse / backend.server:port
That is, the entire URL is appended to the mapped backend URL. This is in keeping with the intent of being a simple but fast reverse proxy switch.
