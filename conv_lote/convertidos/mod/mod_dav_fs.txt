DavLockDB Directive
Description:
Location of the DAV lock database
Syntax:
DavLockDB file-path
Context:
server config, virtual host
Status:
Extension
Module:
mod_dav_fs
Use the DavLockDB directive to specify the full path to the lock database, excluding an extension. If the path is not absolute, it will be taken relative to ServerRoot. The implementation of mod_dav_fs uses a SDBM database to track user locks.
Example
DavLockDB var/DavLock
The directory containing the lock database file must be writable by the User and Group under which Apache is running. For security reasons, you should create a directory for this purpose rather than changing the permissions on an existing directory. In the above example, Apache will create files in the var/ directory under the ServerRoot with the base filename DavLock and extension name chosen by the server.
