The Require Directives
Apache's Require directives are used during the authorization phase to ensure that a user is allowed to access a resource. mod_authz_user extends the authorization types with user and valid-user. 
Since v2.5.0, expressions are supported within the user require directives.
Require user
This directive specifies a list of users that are allowed to gain access.
