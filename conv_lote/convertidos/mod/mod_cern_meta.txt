Apache Module mod_cern_meta
Description:
CERN httpd metafile semantics
Status:
Extension
Module Identifier:
cern_meta_module
Source File:
mod_cern_meta.c
Summary
Emulate the CERN HTTPD Meta file semantics. Meta files are HTTP headers that can be output in addition to the normal range of headers for each file accessed. They appear rather like the Apache .asis files, and are able to provide a crude way of influencing the Expires: header, as well as providing other curiosities. There are many ways to manage meta information, this one was chosen because there is already a large number of CERN users who can exploit this module.
More information on the CERN metafile semantics is available.

MetaDir .web
Context:
server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess
Override:
Indexes
Status:
Extension
Module:
mod_cern_meta
Specifies the name of the directory in which Apache can find meta information files. The directory is usually a 'hidden' subdirectory of the directory that contains the file being accessed. Set to "." to look in the same directory as the file:
MetaDir .
Or, to set it to a subdirectory of the directory containing the files:
MetaDir .meta

MetaFiles Directive
Description:
Activates CERN meta-file processing
Syntax:
MetaFiles on|off
Default:
MetaFiles off
Context:
server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess
Override:

Status:

Module:
mod_cern_meta

MetaSuffix Directive
Description:
File name suffix for the file containing CERN-style meta information
Syntax:
MetaSuffix suffix
Default:
MetaSuffix .meta
Context:
server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess
Override:
Indexes
Status:
Extension
Module:
mod_cern_meta
Specifies the file name suffix for the file containing the meta information. For example, the default values for the two directives will cause a request to DOCUMENT_ROOT/somedir/index.html to look in DOCUMENT_ROOT/somedir/.web/index.html.meta and will use its contents to generate additional MIME header information.
Example:
MetaSuffix .meta
