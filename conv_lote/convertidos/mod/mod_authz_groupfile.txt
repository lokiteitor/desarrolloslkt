The Require Directives
Apache's Require directives are used during the authorization phase to ensure that a user is allowed to access a resource. mod_authz_groupfile extends the authorization types with group and group-file. 
Since v2.5.0, expressions are supported within the groupfile require directives.
Require group
This directive specifies group membership that is required for the user to gain access.
Require group admin
Require file-group
When this directive is specified, the user must be a member of the group assigned to the file being accessed.
Require file-group

AuthGroupFile Directive
Description:
Sets the name of a text file containing the list of user groups for authorization
Syntax:
AuthGroupFile file-path
Context:
directory, .htaccess
Override:
AuthConfig
Status:
Base
Module:
mod_authz_groupfile
The AuthGroupFile directive sets the name of a textual file containing the list of user groups for user authorization. File-path is the path to the group file. If it is not absolute, it is treated as relative to the ServerRoot.
Each line of the group file contains a groupname followed by a colon, followed by the member usernames separated by spaces.
Example:
mygroup: bob joe anne 
Note that searching large text files is very inefficient; AuthDBMGroupFile provides a much better performance.
Security
Make sure that the AuthGroupFile is stored outside the document tree of the web-server; do not put it in the directory that it protects. Otherwise, clients may be able to download the AuthGroupFile.
