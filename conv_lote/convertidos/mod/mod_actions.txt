Apache Module mod_actions
Description:
Execute CGI scripts based on media type or request method.
Status:
Base
Module Identifier:
actions_module
Source File:
mod_actions.c
Summary
This module has two directives. The Action directive lets you run CGI scripts whenever a file of a certain MIME content type is requested. The Script directive lets you run CGI scripts whenever a particular method is used in a request. This makes it much easier to execute scripts that process files.

Action Directive
Description:
Activates a CGI script for a particular handler or content-type
Syntax:
Action action-type cgi-script [virtual]
Context:
server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess
Override:
FileInfo
Status:
Base
Module:
mod_actions
Compatibility:
The virtual modifier and handler passing were introduced in Apache 2.1
This directive adds an action, which will activate cgi-script when action-type is triggered by the request. The cgi-script is the URL-path to a resource that has been designated as a CGI script using ScriptAlias or AddHandler. The action-type can be either a handler or a MIME content type. It sends the URL and file path of the requested document using the standard CGI PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED environment variables. The handler used for the particular request is passed using the REDIRECT_HANDLER variable.
Example: MIME type
# Requests for files of a particular MIME content type:
Action image/gif /cgi-bin/images.cgi
In this example, requests for files with a MIME content type of image/gif will be handled by the specified cgi script /cgi-bin/images.cgi.
Example: File extension
# Files of a particular file extension
AddHandler my-file-type .xyz
Action my-file-type /cgi-bin/program.cgi
In this example, requests for files with a file extension of .xyz are handled by the specified cgi script /cgi-bin/program.cgi.
The optional virtual modifier turns off the check whether the requested file really exists. This is useful, for example, if you want to use the Action directive in virtual locations.
<Location /news>
    SetHandler news-handler
    Action news-handler /cgi-bin/news.cgi virtual
</Location>

Script Directive
Description:
Activates a CGI script for a particular request method.
Syntax:
Script method cgi-script
Context:
server config, virtual host, directory
Status:
Base
Module:
mod_actions
This directive adds an action, which will activate cgi-script when a file is requested using the method of method. The cgi-script is the URL-path to a resource that has been designated as a CGI script using ScriptAlias or AddHandler. The URL and file path of the requested document is sent using the standard CGI PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED environment variables.
Any arbitrary method name may be used. Method names are case-sensitive, so Script PUT and Script put have two entirely different effects. 
Note that the Script command defines default actions only. If a CGI script is called, or some other resource that is capable of handling the requested method internally, it will do so. Also note that Script with a method of GET will only be called if there are query arguments present (e.g., foo.html?hi). Otherwise, the request will proceed normally.
# All GET requests go here
Script GET /cgi-bin/search

# A CGI PUT handler
Script PUT /~bob/put.cgi
