These variables are also provided to CGI scripts as native system environment variables, and available for use in SSI pages. Environment variables may be passed from the shell which invoked the httpd process. Alternatively, environment variables may be set or unset within the configuration process.

Override:
FileInfo
Status:
Base
Module:
mod_env
Specifies one or more native system environment variables to make available as internal environment variables, which are available to Apache HTTP Server modules as well as propagated to CGI scripts and SSI pages. Values come from the native OS environment of the shell which invoked the httpd process.

SetEnv Directive
Description:
Sets environment variables
Syntax:
SetEnv env-variable [value]
Context:
server config, virtual host, directory, .htaccess
Override:
FileInfo
Status:
Base
Module:
mod_env
Sets an internal environment variable, which is then available to Apache HTTP Server modules, and passed on to CGI scripts and SSI pages.
Example
SetEnv SPECIAL_PATH /foo/bin
If you omit the value argument, the variable is set to an empty string.
The internal environment variables set by this directive are set after most early request processing directives are run, such as access control and URI-to-filename mapping. If the environment variable you're setting is meant as input into this early phase of processing such as the RewriteRule directive, you should instead set the environment variable with SetEnvIf.
