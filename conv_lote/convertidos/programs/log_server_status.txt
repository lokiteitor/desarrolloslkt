log_server_status - Log periodic status summaries
This perl script is designed to be run at a frequent interval by something like cron. It connects to the server and downloads the status information. It reformats the information to a single line and logs it to a file. Adjust the variables at the top of the script to specify the location of the resulting logfile. mod_status will need to be loaded and configured in order for this script to do its job.

Usage
The script contains the following section.
my $wherelog = "/usr/local/apache2/logs/";  # Logs will be like "/usr/local/apache2/logs/19960312"
my $server   = "localhost";        # Name of server, could be "www.foo.com"
my $port     = "80";               # Port on server
my $request = "/server-status/?auto";    # Request to send
You'll need to ensure that these variables have the correct values, and you'll need to have the /server-status handler configured at the location specified, and the specified log location needs to be writable by the user which will run the script.
Run the script periodically via cron to produce a daily log file, which can then be used for statistical analysis.
